### WSASS

This is a tool that uses the old WerfaultSecure.exe program to dump the memory of processes protected by PPL (Protected Process Light), such as LSASS.EXE.
The output is in Windows MINIDUMP format.

*This tool automatically replaces the __"MDMP"__ magic header with a PNG magic header.
After the dump is complete, you need to restore the original 4-byte magic at the beginning of the file with the original 4 bytes: __{0x4D, 0x44, 0x4D, 0x50}__ "MDMP".*

### Command Line Syntax

**WSASS.exe path_to_werfaultsecure.exe target_PID**

*Example: __WSASS.exe C:\TMP\WerfaultSecure.exe 888__*
